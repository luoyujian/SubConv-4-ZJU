# APIs
The subsection converter is actually an API. And to support proxy-provider, I implemented another API.  
Here I'm gonna introduce the APIs.  

## /sub
This is the API for subsection converter. It's contained in the link generated by the web ui.  
It accepts GET requests. Here're the parameters:  

| Parameter | Description | Optional | Default | P.S. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| url | The url of original subscription. **It's recommended to be URIComponent encoded.** | No | - | Multiple subsctiptions are supported. You can use newline or "|" to separate them. |
| interval | The update interval of proxies. | Yes | 1800 | Unit: seconds. |
| urlstandby | The url of standby subscription. Proxies in them will onle be add into `üöÄ ÊâãÂä®ÂàáÊç¢` group and will not be classified into region groups. **It's recommended to be URIcomponent encoded.** | Yes | - | Multiple subsctiptions are supported. You can use newline or "|" to separate them. |
| short | If this parameter is set (no matter what value it is), the header part (containing allow-lan, etc.) and the dns part will not be generated. | Yes | - | - |

## /provider
This api can convert a subscription to a proxy-provider config. Each time the proxies is updated by proxy-provider, the api will be called.  
It accepts GET requests. Here're the parameters:  

| Parameter | Description | Optional | Default | P.S. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| url | The url of original subscription. **It's recommended to be URIcomponent encoded.** | No | - | It should be a single subscription. |
