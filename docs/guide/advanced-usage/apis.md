# APIs
The subsection converter is actually an API. And to support proxy-provider, I implemented another API.  
Here I'm gonna introduce the APIs.  

## /sub
This is the API for subsection converter. It's contained in the link generated by the web ui.  
It accepts GET requests. Here're the parameters:  

| Parameter | Description | Optional | Default | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| url | The URL of the original subscription or node sharing link. **It needs to be URIComponent encoded.** | No | - | Multiple subscription links are supported. You can use line breaks or "|" to separate them. |
| interval | The interval of proxy update. | Yes | 1800 | Unit: seconds. |
| urlstandby | The URL of the standby subscription or node sharing link. The proxies in it will only be added to the **manual switch group** (the group whose `"manual"` is `True` in the configuration file), and will not be classified into region groups. **It's recommended to be URIComponent encoded.** | Yes | - | Multiple subscription links are supported. You can use line breaks or "|" to separate them. |
| short | If this parameter is set (regardless of its value), the header section and dns section containing allow-lan will not be generated. | Yes | - | - |

## /provider
This API converts the subscription to the configuration required by proxy-provider. This API will be called whenever the proxy is updated via proxy-provider.

It accepts GET requests. Here're the parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Optional | Default | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| url | The URL of the original subscription. **It needs to be URIComponent encoded.** | No | - | Should be a single subscription link. |
