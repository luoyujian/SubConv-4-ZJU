# Getteing Started

To get started with sub-conv, you can either deploy it on Vercel or deploy it on your own VPS. If you want to try it out first, you can use the demo given in the README of the repo.   

## Deploy
- [Deploy on Vercel](/guide/deploy/vercel)
- [Deploy on VPS](/guide/deploy/vps)

## Usage
Open the link where you deployed sub-conv, and you will see the web UI. It will help you get the link of the new subscription.  
Some feature is not fully supported in the web UI, so you can consult [Advanced Usage](../advanced-usage/apis.md) for more information.
